# PIC based SD card logger

This project is an SD card logger based on a PIC microcotroller.
The goal is to implement a general SD card interface and including FAT16
file system support so the files on the SD card can be read out with a computer.

The particular implementation is done using a PIC18F45K22 microcontroller.

The compiler used is the Microchip XC8 compiler in conjunction with the MPLABX IDE.
